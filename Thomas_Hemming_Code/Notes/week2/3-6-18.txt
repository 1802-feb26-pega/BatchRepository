Schema 
	- a group of related tables belonging to a user or group of users

Databases:
	- organized collection of some data
	- stored on a disc or the cloud
	- shared resource amongst several users
	- generally separated into schemas
	
DBMSs
	- accessing data
	- updating data
	- insert data
	- deleting data
	- secure data 
	- backup & recover
	- maximize data availability
		- (query optimization)
		- optimize performance
	- behave as interface for external applications
	
	
Referential integrity
	- ensures that the relationship between 2 tables remains synchronized during updates and deletes

-ANSI standard (American national standards institute)

SQL - Structured Query Language
	- not a procedural language

PL/SQL (procedural language extension of SQL)

SQL sub languages
	DDL - data definition language 
		- (CREATE ALTER DROP TRUNCATE) - implicit commits inside every command
	DQL - data query language 
	    - (SELECT) - in non-Oracle DBMSs select is not in DML since no manipulation
	DCL - data control language	
		- (GRANT REVOKE)
	TCL - transaction control language 
		- (COMMIT ROLLBACK SAVEPOINT)
	DML - data manipulation language 
	    - (INSERT SELECT UPDATE DELETE)
		
SQL datatypes
	- varchar2(size) - variable argument characters (strings)          	-nvarchar2(size) - only unicode characters				- varchar(size)	- varchar may at some point get updated to do something else, use varchar2
	- number(size, optional_dec_size)
	- long
	- date - yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
	- lobs - large object datatypes
		- blob - binary large object
		- clobs - character large object
		- nclobs - unicode character large object
		
SQL constraints
	- NOT NULL
		- ensures that a column cannot contain null values
	- UNIQUE
		- ensures that all values within a column are distinct
	- PRIMARY KEY
		- combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE, multiple columns of primary keys to form 'composite key'
		- two types
			- natural key
			- surrogate key
	- FOREIGN KEY
		- the PRIMARY KEY from another table, used to establish a relationship between two tables.
	- CHECK
		- ensures that all values in a column meet some specified condition
	- DEFAULT
		- provides a default value if one is not specified during inserts
	- INDEX
		- increases the efficiency through which we can retrieve data fro our database
