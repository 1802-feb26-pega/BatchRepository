Java - Oracle (used to be Sun)

- OOP: 
	- Encapsulation - getters/setters
	
	- Abstraction - ohm's law (v=ir) abstraction of something that actually occurs (idea rather than an event)
				  - simplification
				  
	- Polymorphism - object can be itself or parent class/interface (object also has a reference)
				   - Car c = new Car();
				   - Car c = new SportsCar(); - can't do SportsCar c = new Car();
				   
	- Inheritance - Parent <--> Child and Super <--> Sub (making things from other things)

	
- JVM: Java Virtual Machine
	- different tool depending on the OS, but reads the same file and gives the same output
	- thus portable 
	- in charge of handling runtime environment for .class files
	- java gives java machine code (not normal machine code / assembly language)
	
- Stack
	- Virtualized workspace for the function of your program 
	- static
	- functions (local variables, calls etc.), variables 
	- unique to each thread 
	- local 

- Heap
	- generalized memory that can be quickly accessed 
	- dynamic
	- where your objects actually are
    - global 	

- Compiled (Just-In-Time compiler)

- Write once, Run anywhere
