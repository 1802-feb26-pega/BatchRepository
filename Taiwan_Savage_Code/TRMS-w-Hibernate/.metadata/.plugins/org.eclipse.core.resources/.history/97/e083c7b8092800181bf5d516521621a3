 *	The Reimbursement Request table will house various information surrounded the request
 *
 *	Look up tables are crucial for this project so many of the more complex fields are
 *	pulled from them (grade format, event type, priority, and current status)
 *
 *	There should be a many to one relationship between RR and the Employee table as each
 *	employee can have multiple requests.
 *
 *	The date and location of the request will be stored
 *		I need to make sure that the date object in java will convert over to sql nicely
 *		via hibernate
